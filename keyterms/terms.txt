1. Assertion Library (chai) = tools that we use to verify that our code is running properly.

2. Test Framework (mocha) = tool that provides the basis of test automation and simplifies the automation effort. In contrast to a library,
                            test framework takes your code and provides the testing result.

3. Test Runner = scripts that we provide to run our test suites.

4. Library vs. Framework = The key difference between a library and a framework is "Inversion of Control".
                           When calling a method from a library, you are in control. But with a framework,
                           the control is inverted. The framework calls your code.

5. Deep vs. Shallow Equality = Deep equality

6. Unit Testing = Testing that runs code over a segment of your program checking the input and output.
                  This ensures that individual components of the app work as expected.

7. Integration Testing = Testing that ensures that component collaborations work as expected. They test
                         component API, UI, or side-effects (such as database I/O, logging, etc).

8. TDD (Test-Driven Development) = software development process  where you write tests before you write application code.

9. Late Binding = computer programming mechanism in which the method being called upon an object is looked up by name at runtime.
